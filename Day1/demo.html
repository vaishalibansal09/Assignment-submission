    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <p> A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and
        peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that
        are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>
    <h1>Desktop Computer</h1>
    <p>A desktop computer is a personal computing device designed to fit on top of a typical office desk.

        It houses the physical hardware that makes a computer run and connects to input devices such as the monitor,
        keyboard and mouse users interact with. Desktop computers are commonly used in the enterprise, as well as in
        consumer use cases such as gaming. In the enterprise, they are important because they are the main means for
        many users to do their jobs.</p>

        as a touchpad or pointing stick), with an operating system, a processor and memory into a single unit. Most
        modern laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones, while many also have touchscreens. Laptops
        can be powered either from an internal battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter.
